## Architecture

**General**: HMKIT Crypto C is pure c cryptography layer implementation based on OpenSSL. 

**Crypto.c**: This contains the OpenSSL implementation.

**Crypto.h**: This is the library header file that is needed to conform to the HMKit Core cryptographic abstraction layer.

**commandline**: This is a test and example application for HMKit Crypto C.

## Requirements

HMKit Crypto C is based on OpenSSL 1.1.0

## Contributing

Before starting please read our contribution rules [ðŸ“˜ Contributing](CONTRIBUTE.md)

### Developing

For development we use [HMKit Core](https://github.com/highmobility/hmkit-core) system_test. It is a car and a phone example application with mac Bluetooth. 

1. Go to directory system_test
2. Compile tests with make
3. Run test ./systemtest
